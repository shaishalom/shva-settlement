<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

# EXPLANG

Simple Embeddable Expression Language for Java.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Build and run tests with maven:

```
mvn install
```

The project requires JDK 1.6 at least. The only dependence is JUNIT for tests. The runtime has no dependencies.


### Running REPL


Running REPL:

```
$ ./EXPLANG.sh
Welcome to the EXPLANG REPL!
Please type EXPLANG expressions followed by the NEWLINE
[0]> (+ 1 3 4)
8

[1]>
```

For readline editing support run it with rlwrap:

```
rlwrap ./EXPLANG.sh
```


To run scripts run it with parameters:

./EXPLANG.sh foo.l


To run it with JAVA remote debugging enabled run:
./EXPLANG_debug.sh


To quit from REPL pass it EOF by pressing ^D (^Z on windows).


## Introduction into the language:

### Data types

The language works with  Java Objects.

### Expressions

The language works with expressions that return values. There are no statements.

The expressions can be simple (Atoms) or complex (Lists) that consist of several subexpressions. 

Expressions are separated by whitespace. 


### Self evaluated expressions (literals)

- "foo" "a bar"  String literal
- 1, -2   Integer literals
- 1b, 0b  Byte literals
- 1s, 2s  Short literals
- 1L  0L  Long literals
- 0.5 0e2 Double literals
- 0.5f    Float literals
- NULL NIL null literals
- TRUE FALSE boolean literals
- ()   Empty list

Literals are evaluated into correspondent java objects

### Variable expansion

Simple expressions that are not recognized as literals are evaluated as variables. 
Evaluation of a variable does not exists in current context will cause Runtime Exception
to be thrown. 

### Boolean values

In addition to java Boolean objects any object has effective boolean value:

"" () and zero numeric values of all numeric types has FALSE effactive value.
Rest of objects have effective boolean value of FALSE.

### Complex expressions

Complex expressions are introduced using the list based syntax:
```
( form_name  expr .... )
```

The first expression inside the parentheses is used as name of operation and rest of expressions serve as parameters.
For example *+* is the addition function:

```
[0]> (+ 1 3 4)
8
```
The expressions are evaluated and return single Java Object as result of evaluation.

Complex expressions can be divided into two classes:

####  Function calls

Functions are evaluated in the following way: first all function parameters are evaluated from left to right,
the results of evaluation are substituted in stead of the parameters, then the function is evaluated using the 
computed parameters. Functions can be built-in or user defined. Functions can be built-in (that is written 
in java as part of EXPLANG), user functions written in EXPLANG (introduced using the LAMBDA and DEFUN forms)
as well as user-provided and written in Java (using extension mechanism).

#### Special forms calls 

With special forms order of argument evaluation and the way they are evaluated is part of logic of the special form.
For example in the IF special form
```
(IF a b c)
```
 first of all a will be evaluated, then according to the effective boolean value of *a* will be evaluated only one of 
 the expressions: *b* if *a* is *TRUE* and *c* if a is *FALSE*.

#### 

## List of built-in special forms:

### (DEFUN function-name (parameter-list) expressions-list)

Define a named user-defined explang function. In the following example

```
(DEFUN fact (x) 
	(IF x 
		(* x (fact (- x 1))) 
		1))
(fact 5) 
--> 120
```
a named function with name *fact* is defined and then used to compute factorial of 5.
and the evaluates 

### 'DLET'

(DLET (variables-list) (values-list) (expressions list))

Will bind values in the values-list to variables in the variables-list and
execute expressions with given bindings.

```
(DLET (a b c d) (LIST 1 2 3 4) 
	  (LIST d c b a))
--> (4 3 2 1)
```

### `FUNCTION'

(FUNCTION function_name)

Return function with given name. The parameter will not be expanded as variable. 

```
(FUNCTION LIST)
---> org.dudinea.explang.Funcs$LIST@7daf6ecc
```

### `IF`

(IF a b c)

Conditional expression. If *a* evaluates as true it Will evaluate b and return its value, otherwise c will be evaluated.

### `LAMBDA`

(LAMBDA (parameter-list) expression list) 

Returns anonymous function that accepts given parameters.

###  `LET'

(LET ((var1 value1) ...) expressions-list)

Bind values to variables 

```
(LET ((a 1) 
      (b (+ a 2)))
	 (+ a b))
--> 4
```

The variable bindings are dynamic, that is they depend on the chain of nested execution contexts, context 
become inaccessible and get garbage collected when execution exists from the context.

```
(LET ((a 1))
	(DEFUN get-a () a)
	(get-a))
--> 1

(LET ((a 2))
	(get -a))
--> 2

```

### `PROGN`

Introduce block: evaluate arguments in their order (left to right). Return the value of the last parameter.

```
(PROGN 1 
	(+ 1 2) 
	123)
```

### `QUOTE`

(QUOTE expression)

Return expression without evaluation of forms:

```
(QUOTE (FOO "bar" 1.0 (1)))
---> (FOO "BAR" 1.0 (1))
```

### `WITH-BINDINGS` 

Convert Java map into variable bindings


```
(WITH-BINDINGS 
	(HASHMAP "a" 1 "b" 2) 
	(LIST a b))
--> (1 2)
```

<h1 class="title">How This API Document Is Organized</h1>
<div class="subTitle">This API (Application Programming Interface) document has pages corresponding to the items in the navigation bar, described as follows.</div>
</div>
<div class="contentContainer">
<ul class="blockList">
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Package</h2>
<p>Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for each. This page can contain six categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces (italic)</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Enums</li>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>Errors</li>
<li>Annotation Types</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Class/Interface</h2>
<p>Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class inheritance diagram</li>
<li>Direct Subclasses</li>
<li>All Known Subinterfaces</li>
<li>All Known Implementing Classes</li>
<li>Class/interface declaration</li>
<li>Class/interface description</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nested Class Summary</li>
<li>Field Summary</li>
<li>Constructor Summary</li>
<li>Method Summary</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Field Detail</li>
<li>Constructor Detail</li>
<li>Method Detail</li>
</ul>
<p>Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Annotation Type</h2>
<p>Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation Type declaration</li>
<li>Annotation Type description</li>
<li>Required Element Summary</li>
<li>Optional Element Summary</li>
<li>Element Detail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Enum</h2>
<p>Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enum declaration</li>
<li>Enum description</li>
<li>Enum Constant Summary</li>
<li>Enum Constant Detail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Each documented package, class and interface has its own Use page.  This page describes what packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields use any part of the given class or package. Given a class or interface A, its Use page includes subclasses of A, fields declared as A, methods that return A, and methods and constructors with parameters of type A.  You can access this page by first going to the package, class or interface, then clicking on the "Use" link in the navigation bar.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Tree (Class Hierarchy)</h2>
<p>There is a <a href="overview-tree.html">Class Hierarchy</a> page for all packages, plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page contains a list of classes and a list of interfaces. The classes are organized by inheritance structure starting with <code>java.lang.Object</code>. The interfaces do not inherit from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing the Overview page, clicking on "Tree" displays the hierarchy for all packages.</li>
<li>When viewing a particular package, class or interface page, clicking "Tree" displays the hierarchy for only that package.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Deprecated API</h2>
<p>The <a href="deprecated-list.html">Deprecated API</a> page lists all of the API that have been deprecated. A deprecated API is not recommended for use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement API is usually given. Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Index</h2>
<p>The <a href="index-all.html">Index</a> contains an alphabetic list of all classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Prev/Next</h2>
<p>These links take you to the next or previous class, interface, package, or related page.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Frames/No Frames</h2>
<p>These links show and hide the HTML frames.  All pages are available with or without frames.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>All Classes</h2>
<p>The <a href="allclasses-noframe.html">All Classes</a> link shows all classes and interfaces except non-static nested types.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Serialized Form</h2>
<p>Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its serialization fields and methods. This information is of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any serialized class and clicking "Serialized Form" in the "See also" section of the class description.</p>
</li>
<li class="blockList">
<h2>Constant Field Values</h2>
<p>The <a href="constant-values.html">Constant Field Values</a> page lists the static final fields and their values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
